description: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games, such as Dota 2, have become increasingly popular, with competitions that attract millions of spectators (e.g., <a href="http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/" target="_blank">The International</a>). The large number of professional matches have generated huge amounts of Dota 2 data, which raises the opportunity for applying data analytics and machine learning techniques to obtain interesting insights from the game. <br/> This project is the first step towards understanding which factors are associated with victory prediction models for Dota 2. The goal is to build explainable prediction models for team victory in Dota 2. I further analyze how the factors vary across different types of matches&#58; blowouts (matches where a team outscores the opponent by a large margin or extremely fast) and regular matches.
