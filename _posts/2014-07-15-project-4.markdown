description: Code changes are performed differently depending on the platform of the application&#58; mobile (e.g., Android) or non-mobile (e.g., desktop and web). However, the patterns of evolution of code changes in those platforms are still unknown. This project aimed at investigating the frequency and the co-evolution of different types of code changes in mobile and non-mobile platforms. I investigated 3 types of changes&#58;<br/><br/> &#8226; source code (changes made to source code files) <br/> &#8226; build (changes made to build configuration files) <br/> &#8226; test (changes made to test files) <br/><br/> I collected and analyzed 500K commits from GitHub repositories. For the analysis, I built explanatory regression models to explain the factors that influence the frequency of changes and used a frequent itemset algorithm (Apriori) to reveal the co-occurring types of changes.
