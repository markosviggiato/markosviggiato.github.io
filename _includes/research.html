                    My research interests include data science, machine learning, and artifical intelligence applied to different industry segments, such as the gaming and the software development segments. Overall, I am interested
                    in leveraging those techniques with publicly available data to better understand the state-of-the-practice and obtain actionable insights. </br> </br>

                    In my Ph.D, I have conducted research in applied machine learning and data analytics using computer game data, such as game logs and user-provided game reviews. The main goal of my Ph.D is to enable more effective
                    approaches to leverage publicly available game data to improve data analytics techniques. 🎮 </br> </br>

                    During my M.Sc., I leveraged machine learning and statisical techniques to understand how developers perform code change in different platforms. I also performed a comprehensive qualitative study to investigate
                    how software development practices vary across different software domains, such as games and e-commerce.
